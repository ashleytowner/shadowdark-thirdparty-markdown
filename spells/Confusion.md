*Tier 4, wizard*

**Duration:** Focus
**Range:** Near

You mesmerize one creature you can see in range. The target can't take actions, and it moves in a random direction on its turn. If the target is LV 9+, it may make a WIS check vs. your last spellcasting check at the start of its turn to end the spell.
