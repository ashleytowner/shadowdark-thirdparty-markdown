*Tier 1, priest*

**Duration:** Instant
**Range:** Near

You rebuke undead creatures, forcing them to flee. You must present a holy symbol to cast this spell.

Undead creatures within near of you must make a CHA check vs. your spellcasting check. If a creature fails by 10+ points and is equal to or less than your level, it is destroyed. Otherwise, on a fail, it flees from you for 5 rounds.
