*Tier 5, witch*

**Duration:** Instant
**Range:** Close

A creature you touch has a random stat reduced to 3 (-4) for one week. Roll a d6 to determine which stat: 1. Strength, 2. Dexterity, 3. Constitution, 4. Intelligence, 5. Wisdom, 6. Charisma.

If "you" fail the spellcasting check, you have a random stat reduced to 3 for a week instead.
