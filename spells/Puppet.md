*Tier 1, witch*

**Duration:** Focus
**Range:** Close

One humanoid creature of LV 2 or less you touch becomes ensnared by your movements.

On your turn, the creature mimics all your movements.

If mimicking you would cause the creature to directly harm itself or an ally, it can make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, it resists mimicking you.
