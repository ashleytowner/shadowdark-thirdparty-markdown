*Tier 4, witch*

**Duration:** Focus
**Range:** Near

You conjure a convincing visible and audible illusion within range.

Creatures who perceive the illusion react to it as though it were real, although it can't cause actual harm.

Touching the illusion instantly reveals its false nature.

You may force a creature who interacts with the illusion to make a DC 15 Wisdom check. If the creature fails, it is enchanted by "the" illusion for the spell's duration and seeks to protect it.
