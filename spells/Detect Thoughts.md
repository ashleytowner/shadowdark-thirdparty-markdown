*Tier 2, wizard*

**Duration:** Focus
**Range:** Near

You peer into the mind of one creature you can see within range. Each round, you learn the target’s immediate thoughts.

On its turn, the target makes a Wisdom check vs. your last spellcasting check. If the target succeeds, it notices your presence in its mind and the spell ends.
