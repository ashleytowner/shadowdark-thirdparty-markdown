*Tier 5, wizard*

**Duration:** Instant
**Range:** Far

You send a strobing orb of energy streaking toward a target within range.

Choose an energy type from fire, cold, or electricity. The orb deals 3d8 damage and delivers a concussive blast of the chosen energy type.

If the energy type is anathema to the target's existence (for example, cold energy against a fire elemental), the orb deals double damage to it instead.
