*Tier 1, witch*

**Duration:** Instant
**Range:** Near

You call upon the Willowman to appear in one creature's mind, filling it with supernatural terror.

Choose one creature of LV 2 or less within range. That creature must immediately make a morale check.

Even creatures that are not normally subject to morale checks (such as undead) must do so.
