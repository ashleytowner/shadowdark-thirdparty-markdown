*Tier 5, wizard*

**Duration:** Instant
**Range:** Close

You and any willing creatures you choose within close range teleport to a location you specify on your same plane.

You can travel to a known teleportation sigil or to a location you've been before. Otherwise, you have a 50% chance of arriving off-target.
