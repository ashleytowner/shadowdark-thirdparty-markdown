*Tier 1, witch*

**Duration:** 3 rounds
**Range:** Near

You spin shadowstuff into a convincing visible and audible illusion at a point within near.

The illusion can be as big as a person and can move within a near range of where it appeared.

The illusion can't affect physical objects. Touching the illusion reveals its false nature.
