*Tier 4, priest*

**Duration:** Instant
**Range:** Self

You seek your god's counsel.

Ask the GM up to three yes or no questions. The GM truthfully answers "yes" or "no" to each.

If you cast this spell more than once in 24 hours, treat a failed spellcasting check for it as a critical failure instead.
