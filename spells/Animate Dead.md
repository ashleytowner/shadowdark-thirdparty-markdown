*Tier 3, wizard*

**Duration:** 1 day
**Range:** Close

You touch one humanoidâ€™s remains, and it rises as a zombie or skeleton under your control. The remains must have at least three limbs and its head intact.

The undead creature acts on your turn. After 1 day, the creature collapses into grave dust.
