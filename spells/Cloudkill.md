*Tier 4, wizard*

**Duration:** 5 rounds
**Range:** Far

A putrid cloud of yellow poison fills a near-sized cube within range. It spreads around corners.

Creatures inside the cloud are blinded and take 2d6 damage at the beginning of their turns.

A creature of LV 9 or less that ends its turn fully inside the cloud dies.
