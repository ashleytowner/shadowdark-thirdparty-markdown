*Tier 1, witch*

**Duration:** 1 round
**Range:** Close

You conjure a bubbling cauldron next to you. It can produce one of the following effects:

- Any broken mundane item placed inside the cauldron is repaired.
- A fat, croaking toad leaps out and follows your instructions for the next 3 rounds.
- You can place up to 3 item slots of items inside the cauldron. The cauldron expels these items the next time you "cast" this spell (expelling items counts as the cauldron's single effect).
