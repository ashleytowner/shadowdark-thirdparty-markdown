*Tier 5, witch*

**Duration:** Instant
**Range:** Close

You and any willing creatures you choose within close range step into the dream of a sleeping creature you name that is on your same plane.

You and anyone traveling with you can step out of the creature, appearing next to it as if having teleported there.
