*Tier 5, wizard*

**Duration:** Focus
**Range:** Near

You reach into the outer planes, summoning forth a creature.

You summon an elemental or outsider of LV 7 or less. The creature is under your control and acts on your turn.

If you lose focus on this spell, you lose control of the creature and it becomes hostile toward you and your allies.

You must pass a spellcasting check on your turn to return the creature to the outer planes.
