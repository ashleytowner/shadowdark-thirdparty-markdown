*Tier 5, witch*

**Duration:** Instant
**Range:** Self

You beseech the Mother of Night to lend you power.

Make a single wish, stating it as exactly as possible. Your wish occurs, as interpreted by the GM.

If "you" fail this spellcasting check, the Mother of Night pulls you into The Nightfall for judgment.

You "can't" cast this spell again until you appease her demands.
