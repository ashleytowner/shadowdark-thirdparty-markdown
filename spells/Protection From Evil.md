*Tier 1, priest, wizard*

**Duration:** Focus
**Range:** Close

For the spell’s duration, chaotic beings have disadvantage on attack rolls and hostile spellcasting checks against the target. These beings also can’t possess, compel, or beguile it.

When cast on an already- possessed target, the possessing entity makes a CHA check vs.

the last spellcasting check. On a failure, the entity is expelled.
