*Tier 3, witch*

**Duration:** Instant
**Range:** Close

You whisper into another creature's ear, planting a false memory in its mind.

You describe one brief, false memory that the target believes is true going forward.

If "you" fail this spellcasting check, the GM chooses a short, false memory to plant in your mind instead.
