*A floating mass of rubbery skin crusted with barnacles. Its ten
eyestalks writhe like snakes, and a deep, circular scar mars its
central body, blinding what was once a large eye above a lipless
maw. The Ten-Eyed Oracle stalks the Shadowdark, burbling mad
prophesies and somehow moving freely between the lightless
fathoms of the earth. The keepers of the deep lore suspect The
Ten-Eyed Oracle was once a benevolent ally of mankind, but an
unknown calamity drove it to insanity and reckless hatred.*
