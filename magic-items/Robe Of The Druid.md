*A green velvet robe with a deep hood and hems embroidered with silver leaves and vines.*

**Benefit.** Only a wizard with the Druid title can wear this robe. Your unarmored AC becomes 15 plus your Dexterity modifier. Twice per day, you can regain the ability to cast one lost spell. You have advantage on casting the shapechange spell. When you cast it, its duration is 1 hour instead of focus.
