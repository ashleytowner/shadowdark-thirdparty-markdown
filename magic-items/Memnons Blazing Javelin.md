*This golden javelin occasionally blinks and wavers, briefly turning into a bolt of lightning.*

**Bonus.** +1 javelin. Can only be wielded by a chaotic being. If you also wield Memnon's Discordant Blade and Memnon's Entropic Armor, it becomes a +3 javelin. 

**Benefit.** The javelin always returns to your hand after being thrown. Once per day, when you throw this javelin, you can turn it into lightning as per the lightning bolt spell (no spellcasting check).

MEMNON'S ENTROPIC ARMOR

Deep blue plate mail traced

with gold lightning motifs and

red gems arrayed into the shape
of flames.


**Bonus.** +1 plate mail. Can only be
worn by a chaotic being. If you
also wield Memnon's Discordant

Blade and Memnon's Blazing

Javelin, it becomes +3 plate mail.



**Benefit.** Once per day, you can
speak the armor's command
word. Until your next turn, all
non-magical weapons that
strike you are instantly unmade,
shattering into dust. You take no
damage from them.
