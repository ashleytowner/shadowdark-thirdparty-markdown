*An opalescent ox horn capped with a golden mouthpiece.*

**Benefit.** Only a lawful being can wield the horn. Once per day, you can blow the horn to cast rebuke unholy (pg. 69) with a +4 bonus. A demon or devil who hears the horn has disadvantage on its Charisma check vs. your rebuke unholy spellcasting check.
