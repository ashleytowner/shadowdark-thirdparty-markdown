*A black, leatherbound tome with a grinning demon face embossed on the cover.*

**Benefit.** A chaotic being who reads this tome gains a level and learns the Diabolic language. A non-chaotic being who reads this book must pass a DC 18 Wisdom check or lose one level. After being read, the tome teleports to a far-flung location.
