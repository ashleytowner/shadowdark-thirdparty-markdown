*A thin, weighty rod of dark iron inscribed with spiraling runes.*

**Benefit.** This wand contains the spells dispel magic (pg. 59) and protection from energy (pg. 68). 

**Curse.** Each time you fail a spellcasting check with this wand, you also lose the ability to cast a random spell you know until you complete a rest.
