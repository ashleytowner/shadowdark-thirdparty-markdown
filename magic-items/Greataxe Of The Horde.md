*A jagged greataxe carved from a weighty dragon bone.*

**Bonus.** +2 greataxe. 

**Benefit.** Once per day, you can turn a regular hit with this weapon into a critical hit. 

**Curse.** Each time you go below half your hit points, make a DC 12 Charisma check. On a failure, you enter a battle rage for 1d4 rounds and must attack the nearest creature.
