*A tapered, mithral staff that resonates with arcane power. The tip features an upward- looking eye in a circle of runes.*

**Bonus.** +3 staff. Can only be wielded by a wizard. 

**Benefit.** Functions as a wand of dimension door (pg. 59), fireball (pg. 60), sending (pg. 70), and telekinesis (pg. 72). Unlike a wand, the staff remains intact if you roll a 1 on your spellcasting checks. Hostile spells targeting you are DC 18 to cast.
