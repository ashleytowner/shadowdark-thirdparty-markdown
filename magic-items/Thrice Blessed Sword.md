*A lustrous, golden-handled blade anointed with blessed tears, incense, and prayers. 

**Bonus.** +3 longsword. Only a lawful priest who has achieved the Templar title or higher can wield this sword. 

**Benefit.** You deal double damage against demons, devils, and undead. 

**Personality.** Lawful. Virtuous, naive. Refuses to be wielded against worshippers of lawful gods, especially self-proclaimed converts. Demands each foe be given the chance to convert before being slain.
