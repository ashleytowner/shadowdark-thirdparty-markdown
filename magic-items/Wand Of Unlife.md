*The knobby finger-bone of a swamp troll steeped in acrid embalming fluid.*

**Benefit.** This wand contains the spells animate dead (pg. 54) and create undead (pg. 58). 

**Curse.** Each time you use the wand to cast a spell, you take 1d4 points of Constitution damage. If you reach 0 Constitution from this effect, you die and turn into a zombie.
