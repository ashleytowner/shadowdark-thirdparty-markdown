*A curved scepter tipped with a ruby-eyed, flaring cobra head.*

**Bonus.** +1 staff. 

**Benefit.** All snakes regard you with a friendly attitude unless you do something to upset them. Once per day, you can throw the staff to the ground. It becomes a giant snake for 5 rounds that obeys your mental commands. If the giant snake goes to 0 HP, it reverts into a staff. 

**Curse.** You have disadvantage on attacks and casting hostile spells targeting snakes.
