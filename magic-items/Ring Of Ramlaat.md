*A bone-carved ring with a ram skull. Its horns twist forward and red lights glow in its eye sockets.*

**Benefit.** Once per day, you can enter a rage where you deal double damage for 5 rounds. During the rage, you can't cast spells and enemies have advantage on melee attacks against you. 

**Personality.** Chaotic. Aggressive, overconfident. Seeks to provoke you and your enemies into battle.
