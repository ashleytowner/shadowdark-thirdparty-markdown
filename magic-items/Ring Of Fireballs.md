*A bronze loop with claws holding a red marble. A fiery miasma swirls inside the glass.*

**Benefit.** You can pluck the glass marble from the ring and throw it up to a far distance, causing a fireball spell (pg. 60) to bloom at the site of impact. The glass marble regrows after you successfully complete a rest.
