Deep blue plate mail traced with gold lightning motifs and red gems arrayed into the shape
of flames.

**Bonus.** +1 plate mail. Can only be worn by a chaotic being. If you also wield [[Memnons Discordant Blade]] and [[Memnons Blazing Javelin]], it becomes +3 plate mail.

**Benefit.** Once per day, you can speak the armor's command word. Until your next turn, all non-magical weapons that strike you are instantly unmade, shattering into dust. You take no damage from them.
