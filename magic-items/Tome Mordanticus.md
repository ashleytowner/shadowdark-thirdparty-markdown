*A hand-drawn bestiary of the multiverse's most notable creatures and people.*

**Benefit.** When you read the tome, you learn three True Names (pg. 319) of three beings you choose. Your True Name also appears in the book after reading it. 

**Personality.** Neutral. Pedantic, fussy. The book constantly tries to escape its owner and can telepathically reach out a near distance to any creature.
