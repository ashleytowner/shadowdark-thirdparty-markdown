*A black leather robe with a shadowed cowl and clawed clasps on thin, mithral chains.*

**Benefit.** Only a wizard with the Sorcerer title can wear this robe. Your unarmored AC becomes 15 plus your Dexterity modifier. When you cast a spell that deals damage, add your Intelligence modifier to the total. You have advantage on casting the power word kill spell.
