*A red silk robe with a wide, gold- hemmed mantle. Golden eyes and moons dust its sleeves.*

**Benefit.** Only a wizard with the Archmage title can wear this robe. Your unarmored AC becomes 15 plus your Dexterity modifier. Choose three spells you know. Their spellcasting DC is always 11. You have advantage on casting the disintegrate spell.
