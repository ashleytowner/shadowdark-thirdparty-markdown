# shadowdark third-party markdown

This repo contains an individual markdown file for each of the Spells, Monsters & Magic Items in the Shadowdark RPG Core Rulebook. The files are formatted as closely as can be achieved in markdown to the text in the Shadowdark RPG Core Rulebook. 

These files can be used for personal use, or in your games, they have YAML frontmatter which makes them particularly useful for markdown editors like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). This repository only includes Spells, Monsters & Magic Items from the Core Rulebook, and not from any other supplements, as these are the only ones made available by the Shadowdark Third-Party License. 

## How were these created?

The text was extracted directly from the [Shadowdark RPG Core Rules PDF](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/collections/shadowdark-rpg/products/shadowdark-rpg-pdf) in some cases manually, in some cases via copy & paste, and in some cases using `pdftotext`. The text was then formatted either manually, or using code written by me to format each document & add the YAML frontmatter. **No Generative AI was used in the making or processing of these files**.
